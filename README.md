# Our Company Handbook
*A Collaborative Handbook for our Navigo Team & Community*

This repository serves these purposes:

1. Gives a high-level overview of who we are, what we do, and why we do what we do
2. Our compensation, benefits, and employment policies for our staff and team
3. A cultural glossary of practices, principles, and operating virtues
4. And anything else we might think of...

It's a work-in-progress, something designed to be touched by anyone in our community. I'm particularly interested in getting feedback from new community members as you all will see things that the current team may unintentionally (and intentionally) ignore! Please help us identify our blindspots and **question everything**—[kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)!

I'm so grateful that you're here and that you've decided to commit a season of your life helping to build _meaningful_ and _impactful_ software for the Navigo community! You're here because success isn't possible without you.

[Feel free to [email me](mailto:biyagapatrick@gmail.com) at any time!]

## Operating Virtues

Ben Horowitz via his book [What You Do is Who You Are](https://amzn.to/338OBm7) helped us frame our own:

>Bushido looks like a set of principles, but it’s a set of practices. The samurai defined culture as a code of action, a system not of values but of virtues. A value is merely a belief, but a virtue is a belief that you actively pursue or embody. 
>
>The reason so many efforts to establish “corporate values” are basically worthless is that they emphasize beliefs instead of actions. Culturally, what you believe means nearly nothing. What you do is who you are.

Consequently, here are our current `operating virtues` (taken from our [blog](https://patbi.hashnode.dev/le-projet47-ck3lc9oie00pqeas17q9m3xuu)):


### 1. Table All The Things — `#`
Or, in other words, we “put everything out on the table” — the good, the bad, and most definitely the ugly. Information is the lifeblood of our business which is especially true in a distributed-first organization. This means that we share things in real-time: We don’t wait for the timing to be “perfect” and we’re comfortable with sharing incomplete, imperfect, and unpolished prose. 

Consequently, this means that what we share is going to be, quite often, incomplete, imperfect, and in sore need of serious polishing — we treat all updates with respect, knowing of the courage required to share something that may make the person look foolish, silly, or even stupid. Instead, we engage graciously, responding to the update with the care and attention that we’d hope to receive if it was our own, knowing that they’ve successfully modeled this virtue with excellence.

Finally, #sha means that we’ll often share things that are intensely personal and are only meant for those presently at our table. Everything shared in our communication tools should be held in the highest regard and with strict confidence.

Our table is strong when trust is the foundation.


### 2. Speed of Decision Making — `#`
No bullshit: We are in a fight for our very survival and every single day we make life-altering decisions — sometimes, with very little data. Regardless, we agree with General Patton when he said “A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.” 

That “plan”, by the way, is our first operating virtue, #sha, because our team has mastered the art of communicating plainly the high-level context, the people involved, and the decision(s) that need to be made and by what time (and by whom). We clearly state if consensus or feedback is required and, with enough collective confidence that we can bear, we commit to the decision, even if we may personally disagree. We move the fastest when we are aligned, feelings aside.

Otherwise, you should #sha, providing all the above data and informing the team of your decision with a request for specific people to keep you accountable — this simply means that you will do what you say you’ll do and you’re asking for support in keeping that commitment on track.

## Our Story

My name is [Patrick Biyaga](https://about.me/biyaga), I am the Founder of Thenavigo & See-Docs and Freelance.

Many people have already had the opportunity to read the many articles I have published on the Internet.

My ambition is to help you write reference articles, disseminate your ideas online and be recognized in your field.

Early 2018 - I am at a turning point. 

My life is about to become different from anything I've known so far. The routine that has been mine for 2 years is going to end and my landmarks will disappear.

I jump into the unknown.

I have been waiting for this transition for a long time. 

From the moment I decided to undertake, I take a discipline of one article per week.

Freedom is calling me. The desire to experience new things. To carry out my own projects. To travel more. To organize myself as I want.

It's an exhilarating feeling.

But it also comes with a certain amount of fear and anxiety.

Will I earn enough money? Will I be able to work alone? Do I have what it takes? Aren't I going too fast?

These questions are racing through my head. And, I must say, sometimes keep me awake at night.

But deep down inside, I am confident that I am going to make it.

I've been working and preparing for this moment for 2 years.

"I want to quit. Writing is the worst job in the world."
However, this trust was far from being earned.

When I write my first content in 2018, I have no idea what I'm going to do.

I publish them on Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Hashnode, Github, Substack without thinking and without setting a goal. I know nothing about writing, marketing or audience building. I just write to share my ideas. At no time do I imagine I can make a living out of it.

The more I write, the more I understand how it works. I discover a new world that was unknown to me: the world of creators, bloggers, copywriters, content marketers, writers... who make a living from their writing.

Some of them are salaried. Most of them are independent entrepreneurs who make a good living. Others are even huge stars!

My curiosity is piqued.


I draw two conclusions: I like to write technical articles and it is possible to make a living from them.

Until now, I had an innocent and naive approach to my writing. Now, I feel the desire to move up a gear.

But one question strikes me: why are there so few people who write regularly?

I publish on the Facebook platform, Github... which are, at the moment, very popular. But I can see that there are only a handful of us producing quality content and taking this discipline seriously.

This instils the little seed of doubt in me.

Why are there so few of us producing quality content when there are so many possibilities and opportunities?

At the moment, I don't have an answer to this question. But the more I move forward, the more I understand.

The reason is simple: content production is a lonely, difficult and thankless activity.

First of all, content production is a solitary activity.
By definition, writing means being alone with your text.

With a simple implication: if I want to write seriously and regularly, I have to be alone very often. I may be introverted, but even for people like me, it's not always easy to put up with.

But that's not all.

When I write, I also have to deal with another kind of loneliness.

And this one is even more vicious. It is the feeling that no one understands what I do. Not being able to talk about my ideas, my challenges and my questions to those around me.

I never know if my writing is good. I feel that I am always questioning my work. I am facing myself, my doubts and fears.

I don't count the Saturday and Sunday afternoons I spend alone, in my pajamas, behind my desk to write. Without being able to talk to anyone about it.

Secondly, writing is a difficult activity.
I also realize that it is not only about writing and style. To get results, you have to master a whole bunch of skills:

Constantly generating new content ideas

Know how to build an audience

To have notions of SEO

Define a coherent positioning

Build your email list and newsletter

Be able to communicate publicly

Know how to negotiate and sell yourself when you're freelance

Identify the right platform to use for writing

When I go for it, I don't master any of it.

Finally, writing is ungrateful.
While writing, I discovered a new feeling: that of putting one's guts into an article only to find oneself faced with general indifference. To create something that makes me proud and that nobody is interested in.

When you think about it, it's normal that no one pays attention to what I do. I'm at the beginning of my career as a writer and my articles are not good.

But at first it feels weird.

I realize that it takes time to get real results. I have to be prepared to repeat the effort over time with a well-rounded strategic plan.

On a day-to-day basis, this is not easy to manage. And I ask myself even more: "Is it worth continuing?".

At this moment in my social network review I'm on Twitter and I come across [this article](https://www.startups.com/library/founder-stories/david-heinemeier-hansson)





























## Cultural Quirks

Here are a few things that aren't immediately obvious about us and our team.

**How we refer to ourselves**

- Legally, we are `ROFLCOPTER, INC.` But other than legal docs, you’ll rarely see this.
- Most commonly, we refer to team, project, company as our core product, Navigo.
- Navigo (all caps) is not an acronym.
- You’ll also see accounts under [#](#) or `navigoio` or `NavigoFTW` or `Navigo` (sometimes we couldn’t get just Navigo)
- If "Navigo" is combined with another word, it's not capitalized (e.g. `NavigoIQ`)

**Some terms you’ll see tossed around:**

- `Navigoizen` - Members of our amazing community
- `Navigoiverse` - What we're building as well as our community space
- `Navigoi` or `Navigoni` (what community members named the company mascot, the [Navigoicorn](#))

**My Meeting, My Notes**

- When you call or 'own' the meeting, you are responsible for taking notes and dispersing them along with action items after the meeting so those who weren't able to attend are made aware. We usually just drop those in Slack post-meeting.























































































## Policy Changes and Legal Stuff
*The only constant is change...*

We want all of our policies to be living documents which can improve and change as we learn and grow as a company. This is how we'll propose and make changes to our policies.

Right now, we use the following tools to discuss the Handbook:

1. **GitHub** - The canonical resource. Feel free to open a pull request with context!

2. **In Person Meetings** - Our hope is that as we grow and scale, we'll have more opportunities to gather in-person and virtually to discuss the #handbook openly.



#### Handbook Use, Policy

This Employee Handbook describes the employment policies applicable to all employees of the Company. Where there are differences in the terms applicable to employees in different jurisdictions, the differences are noted in the Handbook. This Handbook is not a contract, express or implied, guaranteeing employment for any specific duration.

This Handbook is designed to familiarize employees with the employment policies of Navigo. Employees should read, understand, and comply with all provisions of the Handbook. It describes many of the responsibilities of an employee and outlines the programs developed by Navigo to benefit its employees.

No Employee Handbook can anticipate every circumstance or question about policy. As Navigo continues to grow and as business needs, employment legislation and economic conditions change, Navigo reserves the right to revise, supplement, or rescind any policies or portion of the Handbook from time to time as it deems appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion. No statement or promise by any other member of the Company can be interpreted as a change in policy nor will it constitute an agreement with an employee. Employees will be notified of such changes to the Employee Handbook as they occur.

Should there be any discrepancy between the Handbook and other documents of the Company, the policies incorporated in the Handbook shall govern. This Employee Handbook supersedes any and all other previous Navigo Employee Handbooks or other Navigo policies, whether written or oral.

Policies set forth in this Handbook are not intended to create a contract, nor are they to be construed to constitute contractual obligations of any kind or a contract of employment between Navigo and any of its employees. No person can enter into an employment contract with Navigo for a specified period of time or make any agreement contrary to this policy without written approval from CEO.

The provisions of the handbook have been developed at the discretion of management and may be audited, amended or cancelled at any time, at Navigo’s sole discretion. Whenever the word “Company” is used, it refers to the employer, “Navigo”.
